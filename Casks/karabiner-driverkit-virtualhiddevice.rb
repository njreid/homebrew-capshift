# Homebrew cask for the standalone Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice
# driver — capshift's dependency for injecting keystrokes, without needing
# the full Karabiner-Elements app.
#
# Upstream: https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice
#
# One-time setup: seed the tap repo with this file:
#   cp homebrew/Casks/karabiner-driverkit-virtualhiddevice.rb \
#     <tap-repo>/Casks/karabiner-driverkit-virtualhiddevice.rb
#
# This cask is NOT auto-updated by capshift's release CI — bump `version`
# and `sha256` by hand when pqrs-org cuts a new driver release.

  caveats <<~EOS
    This installs only the DriverKit virtual-keyboard driver, not the
    Karabiner-Elements app. Two manual steps are still required — macOS
    requires interactive approval for driver extensions, so these can't
    be automated by the installer:

    1. Activate the driver extension (this triggers a macOS approval
       prompt under System Settings → General → Login Items & Extensions
       → Driver Extensions — you must approve it there):
         /Applications/.Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager activate

    2. Run the daemon that mediates between capshift and the driver
       (must run as root; capshift will not work without it):
         sudo '/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/Applications/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon'

       Consider wrapping step 2 in a launchd job so it survives reboots.
