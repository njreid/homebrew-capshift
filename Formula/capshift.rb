# Homebrew formula for capshift — caps-lock chord shortcut daemon.
#
# Published in its own tap:
#   brew tap njreid/capshift
#   brew install capshift
#
# One-time setup: before the first `capshift-v*` release tag is pushed,
# seed the tap repo with this file:
#   cp homebrew/capshift.rb <tap-repo>/Formula/capshift.rb
# Thereafter CI patches version/sha256 in place on every release.

    <<~EOS
      To start capshift now and restart at login:
        brew services start capshift

      Accessibility permission is required for keyboard interception:
        System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → add capshift

      The Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice driver (installed as a
      dependency of this formula) must be activated and its daemon running
      before capshift can inject keystrokes — see:
        brew info --cask njreid/capshift/karabiner-driverkit-virtualhiddevice
